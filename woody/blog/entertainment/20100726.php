<tr><td>The screen-captured image here includes 3 raw video and image viewers I wrote and used in video coding from 1997 to 2010.
<br />The large upper one <i>Speech Workshop</i> was started in 1996 using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2. It has a none video related program name because it started as a raw voice player and analyzer used in voice coding.
The video part was added in 1997 when I began H.263 studying. I was switching from <a href="20100529.php">Borland C++ to MSVC</a> at that time,
in this software there were still many icons from the faded Borland products.
<br />The lower left one <i>Raw Image Viewer</i> was started as a tutorial example of MSVC and video processing for undergraduates in 1998, many of its coding were transferred from the first one.
Although our main focus was voice products for many years, it was used now and then until recently. 
<br />With the coming of PA6488 based H.264 video products, we are providing <a href="../../../pa6488/software/camman.html">CamMan</a>(Palmmicro Camera Manager) as a PA6488 support tool.
<i>CamMan</i> can use file to simulate a live camera, and in this way, it also can be used as a raw video and image viewer.
