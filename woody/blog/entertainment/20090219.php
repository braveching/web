<h1>Ten Years Plan</h1>
<p>Feb 19, 2009
<br />A customer asked if we can keep shipping current <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> for the next ten years. The answer is definitely NO. 
Ten years is too long for a chip's life circle. The only way to do a ten year product is to take the <font color=blue>last order</font> chance and place enough orders for the next ten years plan.
<br />Actually ten years is also very long for a man's life. Looking back myself, ten years ago I only knew how to program under Windows and <a href="../ar1688/20070603.php">Dos</a>. 
I joined the original Palmmicro founded by <a href="../palmmicro/20061123.php">Dr Wang</a> ten years ago in 1999 and began to do embedded software since then. 
During those years, <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> became Centrality, Centrality merged into Sirf, and then Sirf merged into <a href="http://www.csr.com/" target=_blank>CSR</a>, surprisingly, I am an UK company's share holder now.
<br />Check how ten years can change a man, the larger picture was taken in 2008, and smaller in 1997:
