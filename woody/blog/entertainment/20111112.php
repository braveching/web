<h1>Technology Matters</h1>
<p>Nov 12, 2011
<br />Buying the stock of <a href="http://www.actions-semi.com/" target=_blank>Actions Semiconductor</a> in the past 6 years was one of the <a href="20110323.php">worst investment</a> in my life,
resulted huge financial loss, but I still keep an eye on it.
Last week they announced <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Actions-Semiconductor-prnews-2613264220.html" target=_blank>CEO transition</a> and sparked sell-off, and I added ACTS to my position again yesterday.
<br />Because of his technology background, obviously most people do not believe the new CEO Dr.Zhenyu Zhou can improve the shrinking multimedia chip business.
However, I believe Actions need strong technology leader since 3 years ago. Getting a right CEO from buying Mavrix Technology a year ago is a little late, but better than never.
<br />For Dr Zhou himself, I also believe it is a better chance to lead the company to somewhere,
instead of starting his own third company again some time later and sell it for the third time to a vanishing public company like <a href="../../myphoto/photo1997.html">ESS</a> a few years later.
<br />For myself, I do not like to repeat the company selling experiences of Dr Zhou and <a href="../palmmicro/20061123.php">Dr Wang</a>.
And hope to bring <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> all the way to the top by myself.

<h3>Testing Stock PHP Code</h3>
<p>Mar 28, 2016
<br />Since I began writing the <a href="20150818.php">SZ162411</a> net value calculation software, I have been cleanning the PHP code all the time.
A few days ago <a href="http://optimizr.com" target=_blank>optimizr.com</a> sent me a web checking report, reminded me that this stock related web page had quite some places to be optimized.
I felt it is a good chance to test if I have separated the PHP stock code and UI code successfully. The following ACTS price is from related functions:

<h3>IQ to Replace ACTS for My Test</h3>
<p>June 12, 2018
<br />As ACTS delisted, its <a href="20151225.php">Sina Stock Data</a> is not available now. To continue my test, using newly listed <?php EchoMyStockLink('IQ', false); ?> to replace it, hope it can last longer.
