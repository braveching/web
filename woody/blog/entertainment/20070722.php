<h1>Rocket Business Sucks</h1>
<p>July 22, 2007
<br />After spending 100 millions USD, SunRocket closed its internet phone service last week. Now its 200,000 customers need to find new service providers, and I believe many of them will never consider VoIP again. 
Never call youself as some-rocket, because most rockets will drop to ground after going up sky-high.
<br />In the same time, Apple's iPhone is making everybody crazy. Personal communication is doomed to be together with entertainment. 
Communication and consumer devices are merging together. For device manufacturers there is no other way to go but to build a mobile phone with all functions.
